### Hi, I'm Claire! üëã
I am currently looking for an opportunity in the entry-level full-stack developer position.

Here are technologies that I can use:

- Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript (ES6, Node.js), HTML5, CSS, SQL
- Frameworks/Libraries: Express, Flask, Jinja2, Spring Boot, jQuery, React, Bootstrap, Materialize, Material UI
